## Opening Hook (30 seconds) {#opening-hook}

### Script:
> "Every day, APIs handle billions of requests. But what happens when those requests are malicious? Brute force attacks, credential stuffing, data scraping - these aren't hypothetical threats. They're happening right now, costing companies millions in downtime, stolen data, and customer trust.
>
> Traditional security solutions are reactive - they rely on predefined rules and manual intervention. But attackers are smart. They adapt. They evolve. **So we asked ourselves: What if your API could think like an attacker and defend itself autonomously?**
>
> That's what we built."

### Notes:
- Speak with confidence and energy
- Make eye contact with judges
- Use hand gestures to emphasize "think like an attacker"

---

## The Problem (1 minute) {#the-problem}

### Script:
> "Let me paint you a picture of what companies face today:
>
> **First**, there's the credential stuffing attacks. Attackers use leaked password databases to try thousands of login combinations per minute, hoping to break into accounts. Traditional rate limiting catches the obvious ones, but sophisticated attackers use rotating IPs and timing variations to slip through.
>
> **Second**, there's data scraping. Competitors or bad actors systematically query your APIs to steal your entire product catalog, pricing data, or user information. By the time you notice, your competitive advantage is gone.
>
> **Third**, there's the false positive problem. Existing security tools are so aggressive they block legitimate users - imagine a customer trying to search your products five times in a row because they're comparison shopping, and your system locks them out. That's a lost sale.
>
> The real problem? **Current solutions can't adapt.** They use static rules written by humans. Once attackers figure out the rules, game over. And every false positive is money left on the table."

### Slide Suggestions:
- Show statistics: "40% of API traffic is malicious" (Gartner)
- Show diagram: Traditional security (static rules) vs. AI-powered (adaptive learning)
- Screenshots of real attack patterns

## Our Solution (1 minute) {#our-solution}

### Script:
> "We built an AI-powered API security middleware that thinks, learns, and adapts in real-time. Here's how it works:
>
> **Every single API request** that hits your server flows through our middleware - it's completely transparent to your application. Think of it as an intelligent security guard that analyzes every person walking through your door.
>
> Our system captures comprehensive request data - IPs, user agents, request patterns, timing, payloads - and feeds it to a sophisticated **multi-agent AI system** powered by Fetch.AI and Groq's ultra-fast LLMs.
>
> But here's the key innovation: **We don't just detect threats. We learn from every decision we make.**
>
> Using a RAG-based calibration system with ChromaDB, every mitigation decision is stored with semantic reasoning. When a similar pattern appears, our system recalls past decisions and adapts its response. If a human operator says 'that was a false positive,' the system remembers and adjusts its behavior. It literally gets smarter over time.
>
> And we implement **progressive mitigation** - we don't immediately ban users. We start with small delays, then CAPTCHA challenges, then temporary blocks, and only escalate to permanent bans for confirmed threats. This minimizes false positives while maximizing security."

### Key Points to Emphasize:
- ✅ **Transparent integration** - just middleware, no code changes
- ✅ **Multi-agent AI** - specialized intelligence for different attack types
- ✅ **Self-learning** - gets better over time with RAG memory
- ✅ **Progressive mitigation** - smart escalation, minimal false positives

### Slide Suggestions:
- System flow diagram showing request → middleware → AI agents → mitigation
- Progressive mitigation timeline graphic

## Technical Architecture (2 minutes) {#technical-architecture}

### Script:
> "Let me show you the technical architecture, because this is where things get really interesting.
>
> ### **Layer 1: FastAPI Middleware**
> Every request hits our FastAPI middleware first. It does three things:
> 
> 1. **Lightning-fast Redis check** - 'Is this IP or user already mitigated?' If yes, return the appropriate response in milliseconds. No wasted computation.
> 
> 2. **Let the request through** - We process it normally. User experience is never compromised for security.
> 
> 3. **Async logging** - Request data goes to two places simultaneously:
>    - Elasticsearch for searchable historical data
>    - An internal queue that batches requests for AI analysis
>
> ### **Layer 2: Intelligent Agent Pipeline**
> This is our secret sauce. Every 5 seconds or every 100 requests, whichever comes first, a batch of requests is fed into our Fetch.AI agent pipeline.
>
> **Step 1: The Orchestrator Agent**
> - Powered by Groq's Llama-3.1 for blazing-fast classification
> - Analyzes the batch and routes requests to specialized agents
> - Routes to: Auth Agent, Search Agent, or General Agent based on endpoint patterns
>
> **Step 2: Specialized Agents**
> - **Auth Agent**: Expert in detecting credential stuffing, brute force, account enumeration
> - **Search Agent**: Expert in detecting scraping, excessive queries, data exfiltration
> - **General Agent**: Handles everything else with broad threat awareness
> 
> Each specialist uses:
> - **Groq LLMs** for intelligent pattern recognition
> - **Tool calling** to query Elasticsearch for historical context
> - **Custom detection rules** that can be dynamically adjusted
> - **Behavioral analysis** across time windows
>
> They output: 'User X or IP Y should be mitigated at level Z because [semantic reasoning]'
>
> **Step 3: The Calibration Agent - The Brain**
> This is where the magic happens. The Calibration Agent receives mitigation recommendations and:
> 
> 1. **Queries ChromaDB** (vector database) for semantically similar past decisions
>    - 'Have we seen this pattern before?'
>    - 'What mitigation level worked last time?'
>    - 'Did a human override our decision?'
> 
> 2. **Amplifies or downgrades** the mitigation based on historical context
>    - 'Last time we saw 50 failed logins in 30 seconds, we used a temporary ban and it worked'
>    - 'Last time we flagged this search pattern as scraping, it was a false positive - let's use slowdown instead'
> 
> 3. **Saves the decision** to ChromaDB with full reasoning for future reference
> 
> 4. **Applies the mitigation** to Redis with appropriate TTL
>
> ### **Layer 3: Human-in-the-Loop Feedback**
> Security analysts can review mitigations in our dashboard and mark them as correct or incorrect. This feedback is fed back into ChromaDB, creating a continuous learning loop.
>
> ### **Layer 4: Real-Time Dashboard**
> Built with React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui, our dashboard shows:
> - Live request feed via WebSocket
> - Active mitigations with countdowns
> - Historical mitigation decisions with reasoning
> - Attack pattern visualizations
> - One-click test execution to simulate attacks
>
> The entire system is containerized with Docker and orchestrated with docker-compose for easy deployment."

## Live Demo (2 minutes) {#live-demo}

### Demo Flow:

#### **Part 1: Show the Dashboard (30 seconds)**
> "First, let me show you our dashboard. On the left, you can see real-time requests flowing through the system. Each request shows the endpoint, status, IP address, and user. Everything is happening live via WebSocket."

**Actions:**
- Navigate to Dashboard
- Point out the real-time detection log
- Show metrics overview (total requests, active mitigations)

#### **Part 2: Run a Brute Force Attack Test (1 minute)**
> "Now, let's simulate a real attack. I'm going to run our brute force login test. This simulates an attacker trying to break into an account with rapid login attempts."

**Actions:**
1. Click "Run Tests" tab
2. Select "Authentication" test type
3. Click "Run Brute Force Test"
4. Show the logs appearing in real-time
5. Point out: "See these requests flooding in? 50 failed login attempts in just a few seconds"

> "Watch what happens. The system is now batching these requests and sending them to our AI agent pipeline."

**Actions:**
6. Wait 5-10 seconds
7. Navigate to "Detections" tab
8. Show the new mitigation that appeared
9. Click to expand and show the reasoning

> "Look at this. The AI detected the pattern and automatically applied a mitigation. You can see the full reasoning here: 'Multiple failed login attempts detected from IP X in short time window.' It started with a slowdown, and if the attack continues, it will escalate to CAPTCHA, then temporary ban."

#### **Part 3: Show Mitigation in Action (30 seconds)**
> "If we try to make a request from that IP now, watch what happens."

**Actions:**
- Show that subsequent requests are delayed/blocked
- Show the mitigation countdown in the dashboard

#### **Bonus: Show the Chatbot (if time permits)**
> "As a bonus, we've built an AI chatbot powered by the same agent system that can answer questions about your API security in real-time, like 'Show me all failed login attempts in the last hour' or 'Are there any suspicious IPs?'"

## Key Innovation Points (1 minute) {#key-innovations}

### Script:
> "So what makes our system truly innovative? Three key things:
>
> **1. Semantic Memory with RAG**
> Most security systems have a memory problem - they forget. We use ChromaDB to store every mitigation decision with semantic reasoning. When similar patterns emerge, the system recalls not just what it did, but *why* it did it. This creates a security system with institutional knowledge.
>
> **2. Multi-Agent Specialization**
> We don't use a single AI model for everything. We have specialized agents for authentication attacks, scraping attacks, and general threats. Each one is an expert in its domain. They communicate via Fetch.AI's uAgent protocol, creating a distributed intelligence network. This is more accurate and faster than a monolithic approach.
>
> **3. Progressive Mitigation Philosophy**
> We believe in proportional response. Our five-level escalation system - Do Nothing → Slowdown → CAPTCHA → Temporary Ban → Permanent Ban - ensures we never lose a legitimate customer to aggressive security. The system always starts gentle and only escalates when necessary.
>
> And it all runs in real-time with minimal latency thanks to our carefully optimized architecture."

### Slide Suggestions:
- Three innovation cards with icons
- Before/After comparison: Traditional vs. Our System
- Performance metrics: "Mitigation decision in <5 seconds, Mitigation check in <2ms"

## Business Value & Impact (30 seconds) {#business-value}

### Script:
> "Why does this matter? Because API security is a $7 billion market growing at 34% annually. Every company with an API needs protection, but current solutions are expensive, complex, and inflexible.
>
> Our system:
> - **Deploys in minutes** - just add middleware
> - **Scales infinitely** - cloud-native architecture
> - **Costs less** - we use ultra-fast, affordable Groq inference
> - **Gets smarter over time** - unlike static rule engines
> - **Reduces false positives** - protecting revenue while ensuring security
>
> We're not just building a security tool. We're building an autonomous security analyst that never sleeps, never misses a pattern, and learns from every decision."

### Target Customers:
- E-commerce platforms (prevent scraping + account takeover)
- SaaS companies (API rate limiting + fraud detection)
- Fintech (transaction monitoring + account security)
- Any company with public APIs

## Closing (30 seconds) {#closing}

### Script:
> "APIs are the backbone of modern applications. But they're also the biggest attack surface. We've built a system that doesn't just react to threats - it predicts them, learns from them, and adapts autonomously.
>
> With Fetch.AI's agent framework, Groq's lightning-fast inference, and ChromaDB's semantic memory, we've created something unique: **an API security system with a brain.**
>
> Thank you. We're happy to answer any questions."

### Notes:

## 🎯 Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions & Answers:

**Q: How does this compare to existing API security solutions like Cloudflare or AWS WAF?**
> "Great question. Traditional WAFs use static rules and signature matching. They're fast but inflexible. Our system uses AI to detect novel attack patterns in real-time. We're complementary - you'd run our middleware behind a WAF for intelligent, adaptive threat detection."

**Q: What's the latency impact on API requests?**
> "Excellent question. The mitigation check is Redis-based and adds less than 2 milliseconds. The AI analysis happens asynchronously in batches, so it has zero impact on request latency. Users never wait for the AI."

**Q: How do you prevent false positives?**
> "Two mechanisms: First, progressive mitigation - we start with minor slowdowns, not bans. Second, human-in-the-loop feedback. When an operator marks a decision as incorrect, that's fed into our RAG memory and the system adjusts its behavior. Over time, false positives decrease significantly."

**Q: Why Fetch.AI instead of just calling APIs directly?**
> "Fetch.AI's uAgent protocol gives us three advantages: 1) Native support for agent-to-agent communication with message passing, 2) Built-in REST API and WebSocket support for our agents, and 3) The ability to publish agents on Fetch.AI's network for discoverability. It's the perfect framework for building distributed AI agent systems."

**Q: What's the cost compared to traditional security solutions?**
> "We're using Groq for inference, which is 10-18x cheaper than OpenAI while being faster. Redis and Elasticsearch are open source. The entire system can run on a $50/month VPS for small deployments, compared to thousands per month for enterprise security platforms. Plus, you own your data and models."

**Q: Can this work with existing authentication systems?**
> "Absolutely. It's just middleware - completely agnostic to your auth system. Whether you're using OAuth, JWT, session cookies, or custom auth, we capture the request patterns and detect threats. No integration required."

**Q: What happens if the AI makes a wrong decision and blocks a VIP customer?**
> "Two safeguards: First, operators can manually override any mitigation instantly from the dashboard. Second, that override is fed back into the system's memory so it doesn't make the same mistake twice. We also support whitelisting for known VIP IP ranges."

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
> "We've built a fully functional prototype with all core features working. For production, we'd add: rate limiting on the agent pipeline, horizontal scaling with multiple workers, enhanced monitoring/alerting, and more comprehensive test coverage. But the architecture is production-grade."

**Q: How did you build this in one weekend?**
> "Honestly? Very little sleep and a lot of coffee! But seriously, we divided work efficiently: one person on backend + agents, one on frontend, one on DevOps. We also leveraged excellent tools - Groq's speed, Fetch.AI's agent framework, and shadcn's component library saved us enormous time."
