## üéØ OPENING HOOK (30 sec)

"Every day, APIs handle billions of requests. But what happens when those requests are malicious? Brute force attacks, credential stuffing, data scraping - these aren't hypothetical threats. They're happening right now, costing companies millions in downtime, stolen data, and customer trust.

Traditional security solutions are reactive - they rely on predefined rules and manual intervention. But attackers are smart. They adapt. They evolve. **So we asked ourselves: What if your API could think like an attacker and defend itself autonomously?**

That's what we built."

---

## üìâ THE PROBLEM (1 min)

"Let me paint you a picture of what companies face today:

**First**, there's credential stuffing attacks. Attackers use leaked password databases to try thousands of login combinations per minute, hoping to break into accounts. Traditional rate limiting catches the obvious ones, but sophisticated attackers use rotating IPs and timing variations to slip through.

**Second**, there's data scraping. Competitors or bad actors systematically query your APIs to steal your entire product catalog, pricing data, or user information. By the time you notice, your competitive advantage is gone.

**Third**, there's the false positive problem. Existing security tools are so aggressive they block legitimate users - imagine a customer trying to search your products five times in a row because they're comparison shopping, and your system locks them out. That's a lost sale.

The real problem? **Current solutions can't adapt.** They use static rules written by humans. Once attackers figure out the rules, game over. And every false positive is money left on the table."

## üí° OUR SOLUTION (1 min)

"We built an AI-powered API security middleware that thinks, learns, and adapts in real-time. Here's how it works:

**Every single API request** that hits your server flows through our middleware - it's completely transparent to your application. Think of it as an intelligent security guard that analyzes every person walking through your door.

Our system captures comprehensive request data - IPs, user agents, request patterns, timing, payloads - and feeds it to a sophisticated **multi-agent AI system** powered by Fetch.AI and Groq's ultra-fast LLMs.

But here's the key innovation: **We don't just detect threats. We learn from every decision we make.**

Using a RAG-based calibration system with ChromaDB, every mitigation decision is stored with semantic reasoning. When a similar pattern appears, our system recalls past decisions and adapts its response. If a human operator says 'that was a false positive,' the system remembers and adjusts its behavior. It literally gets smarter over time.

And we implement **progressive mitigation** - we don't immediately ban users. We start with small delays, then CAPTCHA challenges, then temporary blocks, and only escalate to permanent bans for confirmed threats. This minimizes false positives while maximizing security."

**Key phrases to emphasize:**
- "completely transparent"
- "multi-agent AI system"
- "learns from every decision"
- "gets smarter over time"
- "progressive mitigation"

## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (2 min)

### Layer 1: FastAPI Middleware
"Every request hits our FastAPI middleware first. It does three things:

1. **Lightning-fast Redis check** - 'Is this IP or user already mitigated?' If yes, return the appropriate response in milliseconds. No wasted computation.

2. **Let the request through** - We process it normally. User experience is never compromised for security.

3. **Async logging** - Request data goes to Elasticsearch and an internal queue that batches requests for AI analysis."

### Layer 2: Intelligent Agent Pipeline
"This is our secret sauce. Every 5 seconds or every 100 requests, a batch is fed into our Fetch.AI agent pipeline.

**The Orchestrator Agent** - powered by Groq's Llama-3.1, analyzes the batch and routes to specialized agents.

**Specialized Agents** - We have three:
- **Auth Agent**: Expert in credential stuffing, brute force, account enumeration
- **Search Agent**: Expert in scraping, excessive queries, data exfiltration  
- **General Agent**: Handles everything else

Each uses Groq LLMs, Elasticsearch queries, and behavioral analysis. They output: 'User X or IP Y should be mitigated at level Z because [reasoning]'

**The Calibration Agent - The Brain** - This is where the magic happens:
1. Queries ChromaDB for semantically similar past decisions
2. Amplifies or downgrades the mitigation based on history
3. Saves the decision with reasoning for future reference
4. Applies the mitigation to Redis"

### Layer 3: Human-in-the-Loop
"Security analysts review mitigations in our dashboard and mark them as correct or incorrect. This feedback creates a continuous learning loop."

### Layer 4: Real-Time Dashboard
"Built with React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui - shows live requests, active mitigations, historical decisions, and one-click test execution."

**Key numbers to mention:**
- Sub-millisecond mitigation checks
- 5-second batch intervals
- Zero latency impact on requests

## üñ•Ô∏è LIVE DEMO (2 min)

### Part 1: Dashboard (30 sec)
"First, let me show you our dashboard. On the left, you can see real-time requests flowing through the system. Each request shows the endpoint, status, IP address, and user. Everything is happening live via WebSocket."

**ACTIONS:** Show dashboard, point out detection log, metrics

### Part 2: Attack Simulation (1 min)
"Now, let's simulate a real attack. I'm going to run our brute force login test. This simulates an attacker trying to break into an account with rapid login attempts."

**ACTIONS:**
1. Navigate to "Run Tests"
2. Select "Authentication"
3. Click "Run Brute Force Test"
4. Show logs flooding in

"See these requests flooding in? 50 failed login attempts in just a few seconds. Watch what happens. The system is now batching these requests and sending them to our AI agent pipeline."

**ACTIONS:**
5. Wait 5-10 seconds
6. Navigate to "Detections" tab
7. Show new mitigation
8. Expand to show reasoning

"Look at this. The AI detected the pattern and automatically applied a mitigation. You can see the full reasoning here. It started with a slowdown, and if the attack continues, it will escalate to CAPTCHA, then temporary ban."

### Part 3: Mitigation in Action (30 sec)
"If we try to make a request from that IP now, watch what happens."

**ACTIONS:** Show blocked/delayed request

## ‚ú® KEY INNOVATIONS (1 min)

"So what makes our system truly innovative? Three key things:

**1. Semantic Memory with RAG**
Most security systems have a memory problem - they forget. We use ChromaDB to store every mitigation decision with semantic reasoning. This creates a security system with institutional knowledge.

**2. Multi-Agent Specialization**
We don't use a single AI model for everything. We have specialized agents for different attack types. They communicate via Fetch.AI's uAgent protocol, creating a distributed intelligence network.

**3. Progressive Mitigation Philosophy**
We believe in proportional response. Our five-level escalation system ensures we never lose a legitimate customer to aggressive security. The system always starts gentle and only escalates when necessary.

And it all runs in real-time with minimal latency."

## üí∞ BUSINESS VALUE (30 sec)

"Why does this matter? Because API security is a $7 billion market growing at 34% annually.

Our system:
- **Deploys in minutes** - just add middleware
- **Scales infinitely** - cloud-native architecture
- **Costs less** - we use ultra-fast, affordable Groq inference
- **Gets smarter over time** - unlike static rule engines
- **Reduces false positives** - protecting revenue while ensuring security

We're not just building a security tool. We're building an autonomous security analyst that never sleeps, never misses a pattern, and learns from every decision."

---

## üé¨ CLOSING (30 sec)

"APIs are the backbone of modern applications. But they're also the biggest attack surface. We've built a system that doesn't just react to threats - it predicts them, learns from them, and adapts autonomously.

With Fetch.AI's agent framework, Groq's lightning-fast inference, and ChromaDB's semantic memory, we've created something unique: **an API security system with a brain.**

Thank you. We're happy to answer any questions."
